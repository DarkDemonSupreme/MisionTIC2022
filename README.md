### Cycle 1
Cycle 1, was the start of the course, and we iniatially started with python, how to download it, how to install it on Windows Environment, etc, then we saw ***Variables***
***Conditional Statements***, ***Loops***, ***Functions***, some of this work can se been on this repo
exactly in the folder Cycle 1.
I apologize because the cycle 1 and cycle 2 is very disordered and can be confusing, the only which has nice organization is the ***Python Challenges***, where I set the statement that they request and his respective solution.

Also one thing I did in Python that I'm proud of, is the ***Blackjack*** minigame that I did to practice Python Syntax, Loops and conditional, even it has a IA, who can beat you.

It can be founded as:

[Blackjack](/Cycle1/Python/Blackjack Basico.py)

I hope you can find this repository useful
And I wish have time to organize it better, comment his lines. etc

I will.
